# Keno-JavaFX-GUI

In this project there will be implementation the popular casino and state lottery game, Keno. This 
is a somewhat simple game to understand and play which should allow you to focus on 
learning GUI development in JavaFX and trying your hand at event driven programing.
This project will be developed as a Maven project using the JavaFX_MavenTemplate.
